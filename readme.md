## Background
![avatar](img/avatar-fufufafa.png)

Fufufafa, the Kaskus legend, allegedly the digital side hustle of Indonesia’s Vice President, Gibran Rakabuming Raka. This account was dropping takes so reckless they could ignite a national debate, funny, politically incorrect, and about as refined as instant noodles at 3 AM. The best part? If true, this man went from ‘*unfiltered meme machine*’ to ‘*respectable statesman*’ in record time. If there’s ever a guidebook on "*How to Clean Up Your Internet Past Before Running for Office*," this saga deserves its own chapter.

There is a dedicated article at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fufufafa) that might give a more complete information.
